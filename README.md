The TangleSwap interface uses token logos from this source, alongside a number of other projects. This collection is intended to grow in a community effort as the ecosystem expands, so please do *feel free to add your token!*

## How to add a token
Please note that brand new tokens are not accepted, the projects have to be sound, with information available, and non-minimal token circulation.

There are two related yet different actions that the issuer of a token may be interested in taking, as explained below.
