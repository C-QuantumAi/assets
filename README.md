The TangleSwap interface uses token logos from this source, alongside a number of other projects. This collection is intended to grow in a community effort as the ecosystem expands, so please do *feel free to add your token!*

## How to add a token
Please note that brand new tokens are not accepted, the projects have to be sound, with information available, and non-minimal token circulation.

There are two related yet different actions that the issuer of a token may be interested in taking, as explained below.

### Adding to this collection

Submit a Pull Request (PR) to this repo by following the instructions below.

- Fork this [TangleSwap Assets](https://github.com/TangleSwap/assets) repo (the button is towards the top-right of the main page).
- Under the chain of your token (e.g. `shimmer`), select the `tokens` folder.
- Add a new sub-folder with the same name as your token address.
- Modify the `info.json` file with your token info (see other existing tokens as an example).
- Replace the `logo.png` by your token's logo. File size ***must*** be 256x256 pixels, and in PNG format. Transparency is allowed.
- Make a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) (PR) with the changes on your fork, to the main [TangleSwap Assets](https://github.com/TangleSwap/assets) repo, with a brief explanation of your token.
- Wait for someone to either comment on or merge your PR. Please feel free to contact the [TangleSwap crew](https://docs.tangleswap.exchange/community/enquiries) to coordinate this process and list the new token on the TangleSwap UI.
